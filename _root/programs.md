Located in the beautiful St. Petersburg area, __{{data.title}}__ is a
licensed Music Together&reg; center.  Founded in 2010,
__{{data.title}}__ is committed to helping families rediscover the
pleasure and educational value of informal music experiences. We
recognize that all children are musical and that every child needs a
stimulating, supportive music environment to achieve basic competence in
the wonderful human capacity for music-making!

### The Music Together Program

For hundreds of thousands of families worldwide, Music Together is
children and their grownups joyfully sharing songs, rhymes, movement,
and instrument play, both in music class and in their daily lives. A
pioneer in early childhood music and movement education, Music Together
offers classes for children from birth through kindergarten, in which
parents and caregivers actively participate.

All children are sounders and movers, and their natural aptitude for
music blossoms in a sufficiently rich music environment. In fact, when
given a supportive music environment, children learn to sing and dance
as naturally as they learn to walk and talk.

How is this possible? Children learn differently than adults.  They
learn instinctively and constantly. They teach themselves through
imitation and play, through being immersed in their environment, and
through every interaction with adults and older children. The
family-like setting of Music Together's mixed-age classes enables
siblings to attend together, creating an ideal learning environment
where infants, toddlers, and preschoolers can freely participate at
their own levels.

##### Music Together Classes

Fully trained, registered Music Together teachers lead groups of six to
twelve children and their parents or caregivers (nannies, babysitters,
grandparents, or relatives) in forty-five minutes of music and movement
experiences.  Each weekly class offers a dozen songs and rhythmic
rhymes, including fingerplays, small- and large-movement activities, and
instrument play.  Children and their adults have opportunities to create
and improvise making up new words to songs, offering movement ideas,
making silly sounds, and sharing musical ideas from the family's play at
home.  The relaxed, playful, non-performance-oriented classroom setting
respects and supports the unique learning styles, developmental levels,
and temperaments of all participants, creating a strong sense of
community.  Families receive two new CDs each semester -- one for home
and one for on-the-go -- along with an illustrated songbook that's
filled with music-making ideas for spontaneous music play beyond the
weekly classes.  (For more information, see our [Curriculum] page)

##### Your Role Is Essential

Young children learn through play and experimentation and by watching
and listening to the grownups they love. Setting an example as an
enthusiastic participator in music activities is the best thing any
parent or caregiver can do to help set a child on the road to a lifelong
love of music. Parents don't need to have music skills -- they just need
a desire to play and have fun with their children! Our teachers are
specially trained to create a safe atmosphere so you can happily join
in, experiment, or even get silly -- and feel closer to your child while
doing so.

##### Music Learning Supports All Learning

Wiggling, singing, and laughing with your child is so much fun, it's
easy to forget how much learning is taking place! Our research-based
curriculum not only develops music skills, it nurtures creativity,
self-expression, and confidence while also supporting social, emotional,
cognitive, and physical development. Because these benefits build over
time, children enjoy the fullest growth in each of these areas when they
participate as consistently as possible up through kindergarten.

### The Music Together Curriculum

The Music Together curriculum includes a mix of original songs and
traditional tunes from the folk, jazz, and world music traditions in a
variety of tonalities and meters. By presenting a range of musical
styles from lyrical to blues, from folk to boogie, Music Together
provides children with a rich music experience that stimulates and
supports their growing music skills and understanding.

Music Together's nine song collections -- each identified by its own
color, instrument name, and graphic -- are presented in a three-year
cycle of three semesters per year. They are non-sequential, so families
may join at any semester and attend class for three full years before
cycling back to re-experience the collections from their growing
children's ever-changing perspectives. Because music learning is
cumulative, with children reaping developmental benefits that build over
time, we encourage their participation for as many years as possible
from infancy through kindergarten.

Music Together CDs have outstanding arrangements that are fun,
sophisticated, and loved by children and grownups alike. The music is
pitched in just the right range for children's voices and includes
songs, rhythmic rhymes, tonal and rhythm patterns, and instrumental
play-alongs. All of the songs are suitable for mixed-age groups, perfect
for childcare centers or families with children of different ages.

Each semester, families receive two CDs -- one for home and one for
on-the-go -- along with an illustrated songbook full of music-making
ideas. In addition, families new to the program receive a parent guide
DVD and booklet, "Music Together at Home: Helping Your Child Grow
Musically."

### Music Together in School

This center is a qualified provider of the licensed Music Together
Preschool program.  You and Me and Music Together offers the licensed
Music Together Preschool program at the following preschools:

- Alegria Montessori

As part of the Music Together Preschool program, Music Together
specialists teach music and movement classes weekly in cooperation with
classroom teachers. Classroom teachers then follow through on the weekly
sessions, adapting activities to their curriculum needs and interests.
Recordings, songbooks, and teaching materials are provided to each
classroom, and children -- bring the music home -- for parent-child
musical play, sharing the songs and activities learned in school.
Children learn from the model of music participation set by both parents
and classroom teachers, and the joy of extended family music in school
and at home creates a natural circle of learning that builds
parent-child, parent-teacher and parent-school relationships.

The Music Together Preschool program provides children with the
opportunity to learn music in developmentally appropriate ways; supports
cognitive, emotional, social, and physical development; gives parents
enjoyable and significant ways to relate to their children; engages
at-risk children; and enhances happiness and well-being in your school
community.
